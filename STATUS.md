## In progress
<!-- Task ID, one-line plan, acceptance criteria restated, files expected to change -->
_none_

## Done (newest first)
<!-- `P0-T01` — short summary — commit abc1234 -->
- `P0-T01` — environment audit: Debian 13.4 x86_64 container, root apt works, all four
  download origins reachable, Mesa llvmpipe gives GL 4.5 core via surfaceless EGL and
  Xvfb, no Python 3.12 yet. [ENVIRONMENT.md](docs/dev/ENVIRONMENT.md) — commit b69cc17

## Plan changes
<!-- Date · what changed · why (evidence link) · affected ADR/phase files -->
- 2026-09-17: ADR-016 adds the pre-P1-T02 evidence gate because the mandatory script
  does not exist yet (real invocation exited 2). Evidence: ENVIRONMENT.md, quality gate
  section. Phase 0, WORKFLOW and AGENTS rule 6 now reference this bounded exception.
- 2026-09-17: human rewrote AGENTS rule 3 — `subprocess` is confined to
  `core/tools/process.py` inside `src/trackstudio/`, while `scripts/`, `spikes/` and
  `tests/` may spawn processes directly with argv lists, explicit timeouts and exit-code
  handling; never `shell=True`; spike code is never copied into `src/`. P0-T02 onward
  follows this. No ADR needed (it tightens the wording of an existing accepted rule).

## Needs human — BLOCKING
<!-- Question · options · agent's recommendation · what is blocked -->
_none_

## Needs human — non-blocking
- Name: the repo and the pending `KICKOFF_PROMPT.md` edit say "CT Studio", ADR-015 still
  says "MKW Track Studio" with package `trackstudio`. Options: keep `trackstudio` as the
  package and use "CT Studio" as the display name (recommended — no code churn, matches
  the repo), or rename the package too (touches every import path). Needed before P1-T01
  writes `pyproject.toml`; not blocking P0.
